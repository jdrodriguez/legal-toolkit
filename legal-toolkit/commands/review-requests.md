Examples:
- `/legal-toolkit:review-requests DUI case, acquittal, client was very happy with outcome`
- `/legal-toolkit:review-requests personal injury settlement, $450K recovery, 8-month case`
- `/legal-toolkit:review-requests criminal defense, charges dismissed, client relieved`

## Workflow

- **Gather inputs**: case disposition, practice area, client relationship quality, target platforms, firm/attorney name, and optional state for ethics rules
- **Assess** whether asking is appropriate based on outcome and relationship (Go / No-Go)
- **Recommend timing** based on case type and disposition
- **Generate scripts**: in-person, email/text, and privacy-conscious versions with personalization brackets
- **Provide platform-specific guidance** for Google, Avvo, Yelp, Facebook, and others
- **Draft follow-up sequence** with Day 7 and Day 21 reminder wording
- **Include ethics compliance checklist** covering bar rules on testimonials and solicitation
- Refer to the `request-reviews` skill (SKILL.md) for scripts, timing strategies, and ethics guidelines
