# /case-pricing -- Case Pricing Calculator

Produce a recommended retainer range for a criminal defense case based on charge type, complexity, jurisdiction, prior record, and aggravating factors. All pricing is a recommended range pending attorney review -- never a final quote.

Examples:
- `/legal-toolkit:case-pricing DUI first offense, BAC 0.12, Florida`
- `/legal-toolkit:case-pricing felony drug possession, prior record, federal court`
- `/legal-toolkit:case-pricing domestic violence misdemeanor, no priors, contested`

## Workflow

- **Classify** the case by charge tier (infraction through serious felony), complexity level, and estimated lifecycle
- **Calculate** a recommended retainer range based on charge type, jurisdiction, prior record, aggravating factors, and trial likelihood
- **Generate** 2-3 payment plan options with accurate math (full upfront, split, extended)
- **Draft** fee justification language the intake rep can use when speaking with the client
- **Flag** cases outside historical norms, unusual factors requiring attorney review, and potential fee dispute triggers
- Refer to the `calculate-pricing` skill (SKILL.md) for pricing frameworks, factor tables, and payment plan templates
