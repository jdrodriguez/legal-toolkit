Examples:
- `/legal-toolkit:entity-extraction ~/cases/johnson-dui/discovery/`
- `/legal-toolkit:entity-extraction ~/cases/martinez/police-reports/ ~/cases/martinez/witness-statements/`
- `/legal-toolkit:entity-extraction ~/cases/complex-fraud/full-document-set/`

## Workflow

- **Validate** the input path (file or directory) and check for supported formats (.pdf, .docx, .txt, .md)
- **Extract** entities using the `map-entities` skill's Python script with spaCy NLP for named entity recognition
- **Present** entity summary: total entities by type (PERSON, ORG, DATE, MONEY, GPE, LAW), most frequent entities, key people, key organizations
- **Highlight** relationships: most connected entities, entity clusters, and cross-document entity appearances
- **Generate** output files: entity_database.xlsx, relationship_graph.html (interactive network), cross_reference_matrix.xlsx, timeline_dates.xlsx, financial_mentions.xlsx
- Refer to the `map-entities` skill (SKILL.md) for NLP model options, minimum mention thresholds, and AI-powered relationship analysis
