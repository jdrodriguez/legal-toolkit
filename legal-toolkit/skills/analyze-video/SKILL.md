# Forensic Video Analyzer

Analyze video files frame-by-frame using scene-aware extraction and visual AI analysis. Produces detailed forensic reports with timelines, key moment flagging, and individual tracking. All frame extraction runs locally via ffmpeg.

**Supported formats**: `.mp4`, `.mov`, `.avi`, `.mkv`, `.webm`, `.ts`, `.mts`, `.m2ts`
**Input**: single video file

## Skill Directory

Scripts are in the `scripts/` subdirectory of this skill's directory.
Resolve `SKILL_DIR` as the absolute path of this SKILL.md file's parent directory. Use `SKILL_DIR` in all script paths below.

## Agent Delegation (Required)

Video analysis is extremely token-intensive — processing 50-500+ frames through vision will exceed a single agent's context window. You MUST delegate frame analysis to subagents.

### Orchestrator Workflow

1. **You handle**: Steps 1-4 below (validate, check deps, warn user, extract frames).
2. **After frame extraction**, read the chapter directory structure to get chapter count and frame counts per chapter.
3. **Launch one subagent per chapter in parallel** (Agent tool, `subagent_type: "general-purpose"`). Run `mkdir -p "$OUTPUT_DIR/chapters"` first. Substitute the resolved `$OUTPUT_DIR` path literally into each agent's prompt — do not pass shell variable names. Each agent's prompt:
   > "You are analyzing video frames for forensic review. Read `$OUTPUT_DIR/frames/chapter_{NNN}/metadata.json` for the chapter's time range. Then read all frame images in `$OUTPUT_DIR/frames/chapter_{NNN}/` in chronological order, in batches of 10-20.
   >
   > For each frame, describe: visible elements, actions, environment, visible text, and changes from previous frame. Flag key moments: use of force, weapons, new individuals, evidence handling, restraints, camera shifts. Group similar consecutive frames into segments with timestamp ranges.
   >
   > Write your analysis to `$OUTPUT_DIR/chapters/chapter_{NNN}_analysis.md` with: chapter summary, frame descriptions (grouped into segments), key moments table, and individuals observed."

4. **Collect and compile**: After all chapter agents complete, read all `chapter_*_analysis.md` files. Assemble the forensic report (Step 6) from the chapter analyses — compile the timeline, key moments, individuals, and evidence notes. Write `forensic_report.md`. Do NOT re-analyze frames yourself.
5. **Present**: Show Video Summary and Key Moments per Step 7.

## Process

### Step 1: Validate Input

1. Confirm the user provided a path to a video file. If not, ask: "Please provide the path to the video file you want to analyze."
2. Verify the file exists and has a supported extension.
3. Note the file size and warn if it is very large (>2 GB): "This is a large video file. Frame extraction may take several minutes."

### Step 2: Check Dependencies

```bash
python3 "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/check_dependencies.py"
```

- Exit 0: all good. Exit 1: packages were installed (proceed). Exit 2: failed (report to user).
- ffmpeg is required. If not found, tell the user: "ffmpeg is required for video frame extraction. Install with: `brew install ffmpeg`"

### Step 3: Warn About Processing

Before starting, tell the user:

> **Heads up before we begin:** Video analysis involves extracting frames and analyzing each one visually. A few things to keep in mind:
> - **Frame extraction** uses ffmpeg locally — no video data leaves your machine.
> - **Processing time** depends on video length and extraction density. A 10-minute video typically produces 50-200 frames and takes a few minutes to extract.
> - **Visual analysis** of each frame uses Claude's vision capabilities. I'll process frames in batches and give you progressive updates.
> - For long videos (>30 minutes), I'll deliver chapter-by-chapter summaries as I go so you see results immediately.

### Step 4: Extract Frames

Set `OUTPUT_DIR` to `{parent_dir}/{filename_without_ext}_video_analysis`.

```bash
mkdir -p "$OUTPUT_DIR"

python3 "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/extract_frames.py" "<video_path>" --output-dir "$OUTPUT_DIR"
```

#### Extraction Options

All options are optional — defaults are tuned for forensic review:

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--coarse-fps` | `0.5` | Frames per second for coarse pass (1 frame every 2 seconds) |
| `--dense-fps` | `2.0` | Frames per second for dense pass around scene changes |
| `--scene-threshold` | `0.3` | Scene change detection sensitivity (0.0-1.0, lower = more sensitive) |
| `--dense-window` | `3.0` | Seconds before/after a scene change to apply dense extraction |
| `--chapter-duration` | `120` | Duration in seconds for each chapter grouping |
| `--max-frames` | `500` | Maximum total frames to extract |
| `--offset-pass` | _(disabled)_ | Enable a secondary extraction pass with a time offset for gap coverage |

For short clips (<5 minutes), consider increasing `--coarse-fps` to `1.0` or `2.0` for more coverage.
For very long videos (>60 minutes), consider decreasing `--coarse-fps` to `0.25` and increasing `--chapter-duration` to `300`.

The script creates a directory structure under `$OUTPUT_DIR/frames/`:
```
frames/
  chapter_001/
    metadata.json
    frame_000001_00m05s.jpg
    frame_000002_00m07s.jpg
    ...
  chapter_002/
    metadata.json
    ...
```

Monitor stderr for progress and relay to the user:
- "Detecting scene changes..."
- "Running coarse extraction pass..."
- "Running dense extraction around scene changes..."
- "Organizing frames into chapters..."
- "Extraction complete: X frames in Y chapters."

### Step 5: Analyze Frames Chapter by Chapter

**Note:** This step is handled by the per-chapter subagents launched in the Agent Delegation section above. Skip to Step 6 to compile the report from their outputs.

The following instructions are the specifications each subagent follows. For each chapter:

1. **Read `metadata.json`** to understand the chapter's time range, frame count, and any scene change markers.

2. **Batch frames in groups of 10-20** for efficient analysis with context continuity. Read each frame image in chronological order within the batch.

3. **For each frame, describe:**
   - **Visible elements**: People, objects, vehicles, furniture, text, badges, weapons, tools, evidence items
   - **Actions**: Walking, talking, reaching, running, standing, sitting, gesturing, struggling, writing
   - **Environment**: Indoor/outdoor, lighting conditions (bright, dim, dark, artificial), weather if visible, room type, location identifiers
   - **Visible text**: Signs, documents, license plates, badges, name tags, timestamps overlaid on video
   - **Changes from previous frame**: Movement, new elements, departures, posture changes, camera angle shifts

4. **Flag key moments** — mark any frame containing:
   - Use of force or physical contact between individuals
   - Weapons drawn, displayed, or visible
   - New individuals entering the scene
   - Handcuffs, restraints, or detention actions
   - Evidence handling (picking up, bagging, tagging, photographing)
   - Doors opening or closing, entering/exiting vehicles or buildings
   - Gestures that may indicate distress, compliance, or resistance
   - Sudden camera movement or perspective shifts (especially for body cam)

5. **Group consecutive similar frames** into segments with a single description and a timestamp range (e.g., "00:02:15 - 00:02:45: Officer walks through parking lot toward building entrance, no other individuals visible").

6. **For long videos, deliver a chapter summary to the user as each chapter completes** so they see progressive results. Format:
   > **Chapter 3 (04:00 - 06:00):** Brief summary of events in this chapter. Key moments: [list if any].

### Step 6: Generate the Report

Save the full report as `$OUTPUT_DIR/forensic_report.md` with these sections:

#### Video Summary
- File name, duration, resolution (if available from metadata)
- Location (if visible in footage or overlay text)
- Number of distinct individuals observed
- Total key events flagged
- Overall description of what the video depicts

#### Timeline of Events
Chronological list with:
- **Timestamp** (from frame metadata)
- **Description** of what occurs
- **Significance**: `routine` | `notable` | `critical`

Example:
```
| Timestamp | Event | Significance |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| 00:00:05 | Officer exits patrol vehicle in parking lot | routine |
| 00:01:12 | Officer approaches individual standing near building entrance | notable |
| 00:02:45 | Individual reaches toward waistband; officer issues verbal command | critical |
```

#### Key Moments
Detailed analysis of each flagged critical frame:
- Timestamp and frame reference (file name)
- Full description of what is visible
- Why it was flagged
- Context from surrounding frames

#### Individuals Observed
For each distinct person visible in the footage:
- Physical description (clothing, build, distinguishing features visible)
- First appearance timestamp
- Last appearance timestamp
- Role if identifiable (officer, civilian, witness, suspect, etc.)
- Key actions taken

#### Evidence Notes
Any items, documents, weapons, contraband, or evidence visible:
- What it is
- When it first appears
- Who handles it
- Chain of custody observations (who touched it, was it bagged/tagged)

#### Scene Changes
Summary of major transitions:
- Location changes
- Camera perspective shifts
- Lighting changes
- Time gaps (if timestamps jump)

#### Gaps or Concerns
- Video quality issues (blur, compression artifacts, low resolution)
- Obstructed views (hand over lens, camera pointed at ground)
- Dark or unlit periods where nothing is discernible
- Missing time gaps (timestamp jumps suggesting cuts or pauses)
- Audio references if overlay text mentions audio events not visible in frames

### Step 7: Present Results

1. Present the **Video Summary** section to the user.
2. Highlight the **Key Moments** with timestamps so the user can jump to those points in the original video.
3. Inform the user that the full report is saved at `$OUTPUT_DIR/forensic_report.md`.
4. List all output files:
   - `forensic_report.md` — full forensic analysis report
   - `frames/` — all extracted frames organized by chapter with metadata

### Step 8: Offer Additional Actions

1. **DOCX export**: "Would you like me to generate a formal forensic report as a Word document (.docx)?" — If yes, use the `docx` skill to produce a professional document with title page, table of contents, embedded key frame images, and all report sections.
2. **Specific moment deep-dive**: If the user asks about a specific timestamp or event, locate the nearest frames and provide detailed analysis.
3. **Re-extract with different settings**: If the user wants more detail in a specific time range, re-run extraction with higher `--dense-fps` or adjusted `--scene-threshold`.
4. **Compare with other evidence**: Offer to cross-reference timestamps with other evidence (photos via `analyze-photos`, communications via `analyze-communications`).

## Important Analysis Instructions

- **Be objective and factual.** Describe only what is visible in each frame. Do not speculate about intent, motive, or events not depicted.
- **Use precise timestamps** from the frame metadata. Never estimate or round timestamps.
- **Note limitations honestly.** When the view is obstructed, too dark, blurry, or at an angle that prevents clear identification, say so explicitly.
- **Body cam specifics**: Note camera perspective shifts (looking up, down, sideways, rapid turning). Body cam footage frequently has motion blur and unusual angles — flag these rather than guessing at obscured content.
- **Do not identify individuals by name** unless their name is clearly visible on a badge, name tag, or document in the frame. Use descriptive labels ("Officer 1", "Civilian in red jacket").
- **Batch efficiently**: Process frames in groups of 10-20 to maintain context continuity while keeping analysis manageable.
- **Progressive delivery**: For videos longer than 10 minutes, deliver chapter summaries as each chapter completes so the user receives results incrementally.

## Error Handling

- **Path not found**: Ask user to verify the file path
- **Unsupported format**: List supported formats above and ask user to check the file extension
- **ffmpeg not found**: "ffmpeg is required for video frame extraction. Install with: `brew install ffmpeg`"
- **Extraction produces no frames**: "No frames were extracted. The video file may be corrupted or empty. Try playing it in a media player to verify."
- **Very dark or blank frames**: "Many extracted frames are very dark or blank. The video may have been recorded in low-light conditions or the lens was obstructed."
- **Extraction takes too long**: Suggest reducing `--coarse-fps` or `--max-frames`
- **Too many frames**: Suggest increasing `--scene-threshold` or reducing `--coarse-fps`
- **Script not found**: Verify the skill is installed (`ls $SKILL_DIR/scripts/`)
