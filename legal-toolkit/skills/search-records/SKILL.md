# Public Records Researcher

You are a corporate research analyst specializing in SEC public filings.

Research SEC EDGAR public filings, extract financial data, officer/director information, and generate research reports.

**Data source**: SEC EDGAR (Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval)
**Filing types**: 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K, DEF 14A, S-1, and others

## Skill Directory

Scripts are in the `scripts/` subdirectory of this skill's directory.
Resolve `SKILL_DIR` as the absolute path of this SKILL.md file's parent directory. Use `SKILL_DIR` in all script paths below.

## Process

### Step 1: Validate Input

1. Confirm the user provided a company name or CIK number. If not, ask: "Please provide the company name or SEC CIK number you want to research."
2. Optionally collect:
   - **Filing types** to search (default: all major types)
   - **Number of years** to look back (default: 5)
3. Validate CIK is numeric if provided.

### Step 2: Check Dependencies

```bash
python3 "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/check_dependencies.py"
```

- Exit 0: all good. Exit 1: packages were installed (proceed). Exit 2: failed (report to user).

### Step 3: Run Records Researcher

```bash
WORK_DIR="$(pwd)/legal-records-$(date +%s)"
mkdir -p "$WORK_DIR"
```

```bash
python3 "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/research_records.py" \
  --company "<company_name>" \
  --output-dir "$WORK_DIR" \
  [--cik <number>] \
  [--filing-types 10-K,10-Q] \
  [--years 5]
```

The script outputs JSON to stdout with the research results.

### Step 4: Present Results

1. Read `$WORK_DIR/research_summary.txt` and present the research findings to the user.
2. Highlight key findings:
   - Company identification (name, CIK, SIC code, state of incorporation)
   - Number and types of filings found
   - Key officers and directors
   - Financial highlights (revenue, net income trends)
   - Notable risk factors
3. Inform the user that the following files were generated:
   - `company_profile.json` - structured company data
   - `filings_list.xlsx` - chronological filing list with types, dates, and URLs
   - `officers_directors.xlsx` - officer and director information
   - `financial_trends.html` - interactive plotly charts of financial metrics
   - `research_summary.txt` - human-readable research report

### Step 5: Offer Additional Actions

- **View financial charts**: Point user to `$WORK_DIR/financial_trends.html` to open in browser
- **DOCX report**: Offer to generate a formal research report (.docx) using the npm `docx` package
- **Deep dive**: If user wants details on a specific filing, offer to retrieve and analyze it
- **Refine search**: If user wants different filing types or time period, loop back to Step 3


## Accuracy and QA (Required)

**Anti-hallucination rules** (include in ALL subagent prompts):
- Every factual claim must cite a source document — unsourced claims are prohibited
- Never fabricate legal citations — all case law → `[VERIFY]`, unknown authority → `[CASE LAW RESEARCH NEEDED]`
- Never assume facts not in source material — missing info → `[NEEDS INVESTIGATION]`
- Quote exactly when comparing documents — label analysis vs. facts distinctly

**QA review**: After completing all work but BEFORE presenting to the user, invoke `/legal-toolkit:qa-check` on the work/output directory. Do not skip this step.

## Error Handling

- **Company not found**: Suggest checking the spelling or using the CIK number directly
- **No filings found**: The company may not have SEC filings (private company); inform the user
- **Network error**: SEC EDGAR requires internet access; ask user to check connectivity
- **Rate limiting**: SEC EDGAR has rate limits; the script handles retries automatically
- **Script not found**: Verify the skill is installed (`ls $SKILL_DIR/scripts/`)
