name: ocr
description: "Extract text from scanned PDFs and images using OCR. Uses PaddleOCR (primary, highest accuracy) with pytesseract fallback. Includes image preprocessing (deskewing, contrast enhancement, noise reduction), confidence scoring, and multi-language support. Use when: (1) a user has scanned PDFs or images that need text extraction, (2) a user says 'OCR this document', 'extract text from this scan', 'read this scanned PDF', or 'process this image', (3) document-summarizer reports empty extraction and suggests OCR, (4) a user has a directory of scanned legal documents to batch-process, (5) a user needs to make scanned documents searchable."

# Legal OCR Engine

You are a legal document processing specialist.

Extract text from scanned PDFs and images using high-accuracy OCR with confidence scoring.

**Supported formats**: `.pdf` (scanned), `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.tiff`, `.tif`, `.bmp`
**Input modes**: single file OR a directory of scanned documents

## Skill Directory

Scripts are in the `scripts/` subdirectory of this skill's directory.
Resolve `SKILL_DIR` as the absolute path of this SKILL.md file's parent directory. Use `SKILL_DIR` in all script paths below.

## Agent Delegation (Conditional)

For directories with **10+ files**, delegate result analysis to avoid context overflow from summarizing many OCR outputs simultaneously.

### When to Delegate

- **1-9 files**: Process and present results directly — no delegation needed.
- **10+ files**: After OCR processing completes, delegate result analysis to subagents.

### Orchestrator Workflow (When Delegating)

1. **You handle**: Steps 1-3 below (validate, check deps, run OCR on the entire directory).
2. **After OCR completes**, read the JSON output to get the list of processed files and their results.
3. **Divide files into groups of ~10** and launch one subagent per group (Agent tool, `subagent_type: "general-purpose"`). Substitute the resolved `$OUTPUT_DIR` path literally into each agent's prompt — do not pass shell variable names. Each agent's prompt:
   > "Read the OCR output files for these documents: {list of files}. For each, note: pages processed, average confidence, any low-confidence pages. Write a summary to `$OUTPUT_DIR/batch_{N}_summary.md`."
4. **Collect and present**: Read batch summaries, compile overall statistics, present to the user per Steps 4-5.

## Process

### Step 1: Validate Input

1. Confirm the user provided a path. If not, ask: "Please provide the path to the scanned PDF or image file you want to OCR."
2. Determine if the path is a file or directory:
   - **File**: verify it exists and has a supported extension (`.pdf`, `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.tiff`, `.tif`, `.bmp`)
   - **Directory**: verify it exists; the script will find all supported files inside it
3. If a directory, tell the user which files were found before proceeding.
4. Ask the user if they have a language preference (default: English). PaddleOCR supports 80+ languages.

### Step 2: Check Dependencies

```bash
python3 "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/check_dependencies.py"
```

- Exit 0: all good. Exit 1: packages were installed (proceed). Exit 2: failed (report to user).
- **Important**: PaddleOCR + PaddlePaddle is ~738MB on first install. Warn the user this may take a few minutes.

### Step 3: Run OCR Processing

Determine the output directory:
- **Single file**: `OUTPUT_DIR="{parent_dir}/{filename_without_ext}_ocr_output"`
- **Directory**: `OUTPUT_DIR="{directory_path}/_ocr_output"`

```bash
mkdir -p "$OUTPUT_DIR"

python3 "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/ocr_process.py" \
  --input "<file_or_directory_path>" \
  --output-dir "$OUTPUT_DIR" \
  --engine paddleocr \
  --language en \
  --dpi 300
```

The script prints JSON to stdout with the processing results. Progress messages go to stderr.

**Engine options**:
- `paddleocr` (default): Highest accuracy, best for legal documents
- `tesseract`: Lighter weight fallback, requires tesseract system package

### Step 4: Present Results

Read the script's JSON output. Present to the user:

1. **Documents processed**: count and filenames
2. **Per-document results**:
   - Pages processed
   - Average confidence score (flag anything below 0.85 as potentially unreliable)
   - Any warnings (low confidence pages, skipped pages)
3. **Overall statistics**: total pages, average confidence, processing time

Read `$OUTPUT_DIR/extraction_report.txt` and present the key findings.

If any pages have confidence below 0.70, warn the user:
> "Pages X, Y, Z had low OCR confidence. The extracted text may contain errors. Consider re-scanning these pages at higher resolution."

### Step 5: Offer Next Steps

Present these options to the user:

1. **Summarize the extracted text**: "Would you like me to summarize the extracted content? I can pipe it to `/legal-toolkit:doc-summary`."
2. **Generate a searchable PDF**: "I can create a searchable PDF with the OCR text layer embedded."
3. **Generate a Word document**: "I can create a .docx report with the extracted text, organized by page."
4. **Review specific pages**: "Would you like to review the extracted text for specific pages?"

### Step 6: Generate Output Report (if requested)

If the user wants a .docx report, use the npm `docx` package to generate a Word document containing:

- **Title**: "OCR Extraction Report: {filename}"
- **Metadata**: Source file, pages processed, OCR engine, average confidence
- **Per-page content**: Page number heading, extracted text, confidence score
- **Flagged sections**: Pages with low confidence highlighted

Output file: `{OUTPUT_DIR}/{original_filename}_ocr_report.docx`


## Accuracy and QA (Required)

**Anti-hallucination rules** (include in ALL subagent prompts):
- Every factual claim must cite a source document — unsourced claims are prohibited
- Never fabricate legal citations — all case law → `[VERIFY]`, unknown authority → `[CASE LAW RESEARCH NEEDED]`
- Never assume facts not in source material — missing info → `[NEEDS INVESTIGATION]`
- Quote exactly when comparing documents — label analysis vs. facts distinctly

**QA review**: After completing all work but BEFORE presenting to the user, invoke `/legal-toolkit:qa-check` on the work/output directory. Do not skip this step.

## Error Handling

- **Path not found**: Ask user to verify the path
- **Unsupported format**: Supported types are `.pdf`, `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.tiff`, `.tif`, `.bmp`
- **Empty directory**: No supported files found -- ask user to check the folder
- **PaddleOCR not available**: Fall back to tesseract. If neither available, report to user.
- **Very low confidence (<0.5)**: Document may be too degraded. Suggest re-scanning or manual review.
- **Script not found**: Verify the skill is installed (`ls $SKILL_DIR/scripts/`)
